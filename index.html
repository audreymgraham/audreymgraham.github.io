<p class="p4"><span class="s1">With the growing levels of depression and anxiety among undergraduate college students, it is important to learn what factors may be contributing to post-class mood. This study aims to investigate how students feel after class based on the quality and quantity of sleep and engagement in class. Using a survey that consisted of three questionnaires, we predicted that both sleep and engagement in class would have positive implications on students’ post-class emotions. While we found insignificant results between both the effects of sleep on post-class mood and the effects of engagement in class on post-class mood (p = 0.08), past literature indicates that these factors do play a significant role in students’ feelings. Despite our study not showing significant results, these findings can be applied to help increase sleep quality and engagement in class even under stress, so that undergraduate students leave school with a positive mood.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>

<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Artificial Intelligence, AI, is one of the most prevalent forces impacting the lives of most Americans not only daily, but constantly. This could be seen as a good thing by some, those who may argue that the benefits of AI outweigh its negatives. Those who donâ€™t share the same opinion may be inclined to ask if AI has malicious intent, not by implemented design, but even flaws in design? If this were to be the case, could we as the humans creating it have any control over the outcome of AI or does it control itself so much internally that there is no hope for its redemption?</span></p>

<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Artificial Intelligence is one of the greatest creations of all time, donâ€™t get me wrong, but there need to be some serious changes. Up to this point in time, the technology which we have created has been incredible and shocked the world, but we have reached a breaking point of sorts. From this point forward, the technology we have made has grown to be so powerful, and advanced that it is growing out of our understanding and comprehension.</span></p>

<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Exploratory Hacking, or non-malicious hacking, exists merely as a passage to gain knowledge and experience of a system. Dorothy Denning is a computer scientist who specialized in information security, cyber-crime, cyber-terrorism, and cryptography. In her book, Concerning Hackers Who Break into Computer Systems, she addresses the concerns of exploratory hacking. A first glimpse into the minds of exploratory hackers comes on page 141 when she explains the two key principles formed at the AI lab of MIT: Access to anything in the world that may teach you something should be unlimited and total, and all information should be free. These two points were the foundation for the ethical reasoning of exploratory hacking, but I believe it to be quite different than what was first laid out here. Some proponents of the ethical hacking movement may be taking the idea of learning and research further than is bound by reason.</span></p>

<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Liberty is the state of being free within society from oppressive restrictions imposed by authority on one's way of life, behavior, or political views.1 Law is the system of rules which a particular country or community recognizes as regulating the actions of its members and which it may enforce by the imposition of penalties.22 The question of which may come first can be categorized in many ways. Maybe which is of more importance, which must be enacted first, which was conceived first? Addressing which comes first is a fundamental concept of importance, character, and the relationship they share.</span></p>

<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Robert Nozick was an amazing philosopher who argued against John Rawls while they worked together at Harvard. Rawls argued for the difference principle and the redistribution of goods across the state based on natural or social disadvantages. This would allow (in theory) for all involved to be benefitted by the work each member of a state adds to the market. Nozick says this is wrong and that taking from someone, whether with good intent or not, would violate the rights of those they were taking from.</span></p>

<p class="p4"><span class="s1">The philosophers Peter Singer and David Schmidtz both share strong, insightful opinions of global poverty and the obligation of developed nations to come to their aid. Each philosopher argues that it is good to give to those who are suffering from measures which are preventable in the sense of total potential fiscal aid. Each philosopher, however, carries their own drastically differing solutions upon how the aid process is carried out, or parameters which define the need for aid. Peter Singerâ€™s arguments for aiding those in need develops core ideas and establishes a platform from which David Schmidtz has extended the terms of argument and outcomes.</span></p>

<p class="p4"><span class="s1">In The Case of Working With Your Hands, Matthew Crawford explains the value of trade skills and how they beneficially differ from desk jobs. Crawford explained in his essay how the many jobs he worked varied. Some of which were desk jobs, and others were handywork. Crawford explains how when he worked in his desk job, as a writer, he felt the work he was producing was less valuable because he couldnâ€™t put his best effort into it. He was put on such a time crunch expected to produce so many pieces in such a short amount of time, that it was more about â€œgetting it done.â€ This varies greatly from the status quo which says that desk jobs are more valuable and important than trade jobs. Though when Crawford worked as a bike mechanic, he felt that all the work was valuable because he could put his best work into everything he did. This parries with the belief that a position that requires more knowledge produces more achievement.</span></p>

<p class="p4"><span class="s1">According to Paul Camenisch, the way to evaluate products begins with the assessment of whether the product will enhance or detract from the human condition; if a business does not enhance the human condition, then it is morally questionable even if the business takes morally appropriate measures to producing this product. If a business is dedicated to a product, the product will be better, then profit will follow, but if they are dedicated to profit, there is no guarantee the product will be good, even if it is more profitable. Companies must have a distinct understanding of where they will place their focus to make a product that will benefit the human condition.</span></p>

<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Following the bombing of Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941, President F.D.R. addressed a joint session of congress the next day asking for war to be declared on Japan. 33 minutes after he had completed his initial speech, congress declared war on Japan. With so much uncertainty and fear, the suspicion of fifth column activity lead to the creation of a commission under Chief Justice Owen Roberts. Without the time to gather factual evidence, a report was made based off suspicion of a threat inland United States. Even after the FBI deemed no real threat, F.D.R. issued Executive Order 9066, handing power over to the U.S. military. This allowed for any action deemed necessary to protect the country, including the power to relocate any citizen deemed a threat to the U.S. Relocation of all 120,000 Japanese American citizens began almost immediately.</span></p>
