                    One of my active projects involves generating
                    statistical models for salt data to have an
                    ever-changing and evolving hash.

                    The ultimate combination.

                    Bringing together all of these technologies
                    into one perfect platform that relies heavily
                    on offloading computation power for high-
                    efficiency with higher energy perfomance.

                    Combining the power of statistical Cryptography
                    would allow equally great security for this 
                    dream system.

                    I'm currently an undergraduate Junior at Iowa State 
                    University studying Computer Science and Pre-Law 
                    with minors in Data Science and Cyber Security.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As a student, I enjoy being involved in many 
                    actitives and clubs.
                    <br>
                    As a member of the
                    Computer Science and Engineering Club, I have
                    helped develop the club's website using several
                    technologies including, but not limited to, HTML,
                    CSS, JS, Flask, and Python.
                    <br>
                    As a member of Kappa Sigma fraterinity, I have 
                    connected most-to-all of the members (brothers)
                    to campus events, campus clubs, internships,
                    and even fulltime jobs.

                    Previously, as a member of the Geoffroy Hall
                    Cabinet, I managed social events, interpersonal,
                    and campus events.

                <p>
                    My computer science and software engineering path
                    began at a very early age when I first discovered
                    programming.
                    This led me to discover new technologies that
                    inspired me and I share my story to inspire others.
